# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
#
# WhateverModel.delete_all
#
# BASE_URL =
# PLAYER_URLS = {
#   "Sidney Crosby" => "https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/c/crosbsi01.html",
#   "Evgeni Malkin" => "https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/m/malkiev01.html",
#   }
#
# PLAYER_URLS.keys.each do |key|
#   scraper = NHLScraper.new(PLAYER_URLS[key])
#   scraper.scrape
#   # scraper data will be an array of data
#   # scraper.data.each do |data|
